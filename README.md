# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the **price of used cars** based on features like manufacturing year, kilometers driven, and fuel type using **Linear Regression**.  
It demonstrates a simple end-to-end **ML pipeline** including:
- Data preprocessing (One-Hot Encoding)
- Model training and evaluation
- Example predictions

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Custom CSV file (`Book1.csv.csv`)
- **Features**:
  - `year` - Year of manufacture
  - `kms_driven` - Total kilometers driven
  - `fuel_type` - Type of fuel (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, etc.)
- **Target**:
  - `Price` - Selling price of the car (in ₹)

## ⚙️ Features of the Project
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- One-Hot Encoding for categorical features
- Model training using **Linear Regression**
- Model evaluation using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- Predicting car price for new input data

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
